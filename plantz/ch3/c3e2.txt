Store a digit in every four bits. Thus, the lowest-order digit would be stored in bits 7 – 0, the next lowest-order in 15 – 8, etc., with the highest-order digit in bits 31 – 24.

No, binary addition does not work. For example, let’s consider 48 + 27:

number  32 bits (hex)
48      ==> 00000048 
+ 27    ==> 00000027
